# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fresh BITS Pilani grad (2025 batch) who went from writing code to building AI solutions â€” and honestly, it's been quite a ride. [This is my blog!](/blog)

## My Story

Back in college, I was that person debugging code at 3 AM and actually enjoying it. But somewhere along the way, I realized I was more interested in the "why" behind what we were building than just the "how." So here I am now, working on AI solutions for enterprises, trying to make sure the cool tech we build actually solves real problems.

## What I'm Up To

These days, I'm all about figuring out how to make AI work for big companies without making it feel like rocket science. My developer background comes in handyâ€”I can actually understand what the engineering team is talking about (most of the time ðŸ˜…), which makes everything smoother.

I spend my time:
- Finding ways AI can actually help businesses (not just sound impressive in meetings)
- Translating between "tech speak" and "business speak"
- Making sure we build stuff people will actually use
- Occasionally geeking out about the latest AI developments

## My Take

Having been on both sides â€” coding features and now deciding which features to buildâ€”I've learned that the best products happen when you understand both the tech and the people using it. My engineering days at BITS taught me how things work under the hood, and now I use that knowledge to build products that make sense.

I'm basically trying to make enterprise AI less intimidating and more useful. Because let's be real, AI should make our work lives easier, not more complicated.

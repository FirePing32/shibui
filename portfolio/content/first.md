# To Jhunu

Every moment with you feels like a gentle breeze on a warm evening â€“ soft, comforting, and exactly what my soul needs. You have this incredible, almost magical way of transforming ordinary days into extraordinary treasures, turning simple conversations into precious memories I want to hold onto forever. There's something profound in the way you make the mundane feel magnificent, the way you find beauty in the smallest things and help me see the world through wonder-filled eyes.

Your laugh is my favorite symphony, a melody that plays on repeat in my heart. Your smile has this remarkable power to illuminate even my darkest days, breaking through clouds I thought were permanent, reminding me that light always finds a way. In your eyes, I see a reflection of myself that I never knew existed â€“ someone worthy, someone capable, someone loved unconditionally. You see the best in me, even when I can't see it myself, and you love me with a patience and kindness that leaves me breathless and in complete awe.

With you, Jhunu, I've discovered something I didn't even know I was searching for â€“ not just love, but home. You're my best friend, my confidant, my safe harbor in every storm. You're the person who makes everything better simply by existing in my world, by choosing to walk this path alongside me. The comfort I find in your presence is unlike anything I've ever known â€“ it's the feeling of finally being exactly where I'm meant to be.
One year ago, we began writing our story together, and with each passing day, each shared laugh, each quiet moment of understanding, I fall deeper in love with you. You've shown me what it means to be truly seen, truly known, and truly cherished.

Here's to us, my love â€“ to all the little moments that make up our beautiful ordinary, and to all the big adventures that await us on the horizon. Here's to the late-night conversations, the spontaneous laughter, the comfortable silences, and the dreams we're building together. I love you more than words could ever capture, more than any language could express. You are my today and all of my tomorrows.

Forever yours,<br>
Prakhar
